# Algorithms for Speech and NLP

This course will present the full stack of speech and language technology, from automatic speech recognition to parsing and semantic processing. The course will present, at each level, the key principles, algorithms and mathematical principles behind the state of the art, and confront them with what is know about human speech and language processing. Students will acquire detailed knowledge of the scientific issues and computational techniques in automatic speech and language processing and will have hands on experience in implementing and evaluating the important algorithms.

First Project : Speech features & signal processing : A use of Melfilterbanks or MFCC for features extraction and using Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron in order to classify different voices.

Second Project : Language Models : Vizualizations with Weigthed Finite State Transducers, Implementation: Edit Distance/Levenshtein with Finite State Transducers and Composition of FSTs to Detect mispelled words/Generate candidate words.

Third Project : a simple normalisation system that can change raw English tweets into (partially) normalised tweets, suitable for further NLP processing using context2vec in order to correct mispelled words using the contextual information of words surrounding them.

Fourth Project : Developement of a basic probabilistic parser for French based on the CYK algorithm and the PCFG model using the SEQUOIA treebank v6.0.
