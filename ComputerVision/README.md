# Computer Vision

The objective of this course: Automated object recognition - and more generally scene analysis - from photographs and videos is the great challenge of computer vision. The objective of this course is to provide a coherent introductory overview of the image, object and scene models, as well as the methods and algorithms, used today to address this challenge.

First Assignement : Instance-level recognition : Sparse features for matching specific objects in images, Affine co-variant detectors, Towards large scale retrieval and Large scale retrieval. Matlab code : useless to upload it here.

Second Assignement : Image classification : Training and testing an Image Classifier, Training an Image Classifier for Retrieval using Internet image search and Advanced Encoding Methods. Matlab code : useless to upload it here.

Third Assignement :  Neural networks : Training a fully connected neural network, CNN building blocks, back-propagation and derivatives,  learning a character CNN then using pretrained models for performance comparaison with the classifier from the second assignement.

Final Project : Training CNNs using synthetic Images of People.

The grade I got :  14/20
